Project proposal goes here.

## list of ideas
1) How can we add GAN patches to NSFW content such that Reddit wouldn't be able to flag it... as an extension adding patches to guns or knives so that security or surveillance models cannot recognize them.
2) Adding noise to image for fooling automatic image to text conversion tools... appications code copying
